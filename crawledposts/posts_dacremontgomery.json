She‚Äôs the one that wakes up in a different hotel room everyday, because she‚Äôs there supporting me. She‚Äôs the one that has to deal with me coming home (exhausted) acting like an absolute basket case. She‚Äôs the one that helps me flesh out every idea. She‚Äôs the sounding board and the intelligence. She‚Äôs the emotional support and also the person that allows me to live in the present and not take some things too seriously.
