It is thought that Villa Oplontis was owned by Nero and used as his second wife’s residence; its colorful frescoes have been remarkably preserved. Some say he was an avant-garde artist and visionary, his brutality simply a product of his time. Other historians define him by his obsession with popularity, and his desire for a godlike authority.
