There have been 74,000 fires in the Brazilian Amazon since the beginning of this year‚Äîa staggering 84% increase over the same period last year (National Institute for Space Research, Brazil). Scientists and conservationists attribute the accelerating deforestation to President Jair Bolsonaro, who issued an open invitation to loggers and farmers to clear the land after taking office in January.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nThe largest rainforest in the world is a critical piece of the global climate solution.
