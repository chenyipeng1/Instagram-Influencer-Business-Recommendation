Its really hard to post “bad skin days” in the perfect world of instagram (especially when you’re an “influencer”) .\n😊BUT THEN.. I remembered the reason why I started making DIY videos 9 years ago.. and that’s to help. If this video can help just ONE person.. thats all I could ever ask for.. so here I am, putting it all out there and posting one of the worst skin days I’ve had in a really long time. I broke out like I was 13 all over again.. the breakouts I can get over, but my skin gets hyperpigmentation SO fast.. like THANOS SNAP and I have hyperpigmentation\n.\n🔥so this is what I do to kill the acne, but mostly, prevent it from leaving a dark spot/scar. Ive been doing this for 5+ years and those of you who’ve been watching me for years have noticed that the darkness around my mouth has gotten significantly lighter and its because of this! .\n🤓Before I get into the steps, I just want to make it clear that hyperpigmentation isn’t something that goes away overnight. You need to use this consistently, and if you have old hyperpigmentation, it can take much longer to fade and isn’t guaranteed to go away completely, but it WILL fade.. but with that being said, prevention is key and taking care of it right when it happens helps a LOT!\n.\n🤩I MAKE MY OWN PEEL/EXFOLIATING PADS using just 1 ingredient! .\n🍍U NEED FRESH PINEAPPLE JUICE.. juice it yourself or buy it from a store (no added sugar plz) 🥚Put some cotton rounds in a mason jar + soak with the juice\n❄️*KEEP refrigerated*\n🍌Use this every other night as a peel (use less if your skin is sensitive) 💦Leave on for 15 mins then rinse with lukewarm water\n.\n🤷🏽‍♀️WHY THIS WORKS:\nPINEAPPLE juice has AHA's which gently exfoliate and get rid of dead skin cells.\nenzyme BROMELAIN helps to kill + prevent acne.\nhigh in VITAMIN C..helps fade dark spots, brighten skin and make it even .\nDisclaimer: Test patch 1st! .\n🎵SONG: @balconytheband - HOPE\n.\n👍🏾LIKE THIS VIDEO for MORE DIY and TAG A FRIEND who could use this!👇🏽\n.\n#farahdhukai #diy #diyvideo #acne"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2xARheAqXk/", "datetime": "2019-09-23T19:38:07.000Z", "img_urls": ["https://scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/3f07b868828f4bca075301484a1fd230/5DC67678/t51.2885-15/e35/70634160_143564040201310_1170986853287190000_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110"], "views": 1684030, "likes": 96827, "caption": "😍Watches Euphoria once… gets hella inspired by @donni.davy to recreate a look that I’ve never felt comfortable wearing until now.

And yes, I could appreciate him in real life (which I do every day, minus the times I’m hangry) but I wanted to share a little piece of our trip with the inter webs…because if its not on instagram did it really happen? ha\n.\n🏝Bora Bora has been on our bucket list since we were just two broke young kids in love and I never could have imagined that we would be here.. seeing one of the most beautiful places on earth IN REAL LIFE! But let me tell you..making this happen without him knowing was HELLA HARD. Mostly because he’s a nosy uncle that has to know everything, but after hours of telling him to just trust me to plan something (he’s suspicious of me because I watch murder documentaries on Netflix 🤷🏽‍♀️) I was finally able to bring him to a place where he can take some time to himself aka pay attention to me... no working... No thinking (thoughts about me are allowed)… and just living our best lives. So thankful I get to go through life with you by my side @lifeofsal … even when you use uncle pick up lines on me on the daily 👵🏾👴🏾"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2FGFTyAs37/", "datetime": "2019-09-06T18:23:51.000Z", "img_urls": ["https://scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/2506bccd6a50472dc66b1cae13e236cf/5DC643D3/t51.2885-15/e35/68912229_2130237223936942_1521667074202689740_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110"], "views": 2400962, "likes": 207566, "caption": "😳HAIR HACK: HOW I TRICK PEOPLE INTO THINKING I WASH MY HAIR\n.\n🥳I posted this on my stories a while ago and a lot of you have been DM’ing me telling me how much you LOVE this HAIR HACK! So..I thought id post it on my feed for those of you who missed my story🙃\n.\n🤓THIS is how I get away with not washing my hair for 2 weeks (among other hacks which ill share later)…Ive been doing this trick since ive been in high school because aint nobody wanna get up early just to style their hair. You’ll save 3.1459 million hours and look fresh and cute af and not a single soul will know that you didn’t wash your hair.\n.\n🍌Just section off the TOP of your hair .. no need to worry about the rest because the top covers the rest :) its like our “clean mask” hiding all the greasy roots underneath. If you have OILY SIDES then section your hair in a T… from top of the ear to top of ear and then going back like how I did.\n.\n💦WASH THAT SECTION ONLY with shampoo.. and then style it to match the rest of your hair. I’m using a diy leave in growth/heat protectant/shine/strength spray which I’ll have up on my feed soon!\n.\n🙆🏽‍♀️Boom. Look fresh, clean and like you took so long to style your hair but really you just hair hacked it!! Work smarter not harder my friends. .\n❄️*i don’t use dry shampoo as often because it makes my scalp feel icky and heavy*\n.\n👍🏾LIKE this video for more EASY TIME SAVING HACKS LIKE THIS! And dont forget to TAG A LAZY FRIEND WHO HATES WASHING THEIR HAIR!👇🏽👇🏽\n.\n🤷🏽‍♀️Disclaimer: not washing your hair is not the same as not showering. Please shower. .\n🎵: @amaalnuux - later\n.\n#farahdhukai #hairhack #hair #hairvideo"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B19i-GYgzyZ/", "datetime": "2019-09-03T19:59:23.000Z", "img_urls": ["https://scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a9e37c5b71cb64044d39ae6fefbea7bb/5E489B20/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/69075232_160289198498826_2526592944834571740_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106"], "likes": 489958, "caption": "🤦🏾‍♀️I get comments all the time about how I’m overweight and that I “need to diet” or just a bunch of 🤮 and 🐷🐖emojis... so in order to find the solution to my weight affecting a strangers life, I hopped my “overweight” ass on a plane.. travelled across the world, even went to the middle of the ocean...\n.\n🤷🏽‍♀️BUT ALAS.... still not a single f*ck in sight.

Embrace your freckles and LOVE them cuz some of us (like me) aren’t lucky enough to have them and gotta tattoo them on to live our best faux freckled lives! .\n☺️I guess we get so “used” to our features that we dont realize how beautiful we look to a stranger..and we always want what we dont have.. SO for the DIY..Look in the mirror, get real close, stare a little longer and tell yourself just how beautiful you are. Thats it. That’s the diy.\n.\n🎵SONG: @teflonsega - GHOST\n.\nDisclaimer: please use 100% natural henna. Make it yourself (which is what I did) Fake henna can cause chemical burns that could last you a lifetime.
