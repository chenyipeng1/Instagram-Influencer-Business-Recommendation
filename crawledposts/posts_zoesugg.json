Introducing Zoella X @Bagandbones 💗 over the past year myself & the team have designed two very special lights with the @bagandbones team (they make the most incredible LED Neons) It’s been so fun working on a creative project unlike anything I’ve ever done before & I’m so thrilled with them! The first is a showstopping ‘Wouldn’t it be nice’ piece inspired by the classic Beach Boys song about youthful love which is one of my favourite songs! It always pulls me out of a funk & makes me smile! (You can pre order this in a choice of 4 colours, I have the white here in my bedroom) 100% of the profits from the sale of this light will be donated to @Mindcharity. The second light is a super fun pair of boobs to serve as a reminder to check them regularly! These also come with the choice of 3 different style nipple stickers (hearts, stars or crosses) 100% of the profits from the sale of this light will be donated to @coppafeelpeople. I really hope you love them as much as we all do, and these two charities mean a lot to me and the team, so we’re delighted to be raising funds for them both! The link to shop is in my bio 🙌🏼 .\n.\nIf you want the chance to win one in a giveaway, head over to @Zoella account for the details and enter there! 🧡🧡"}]
