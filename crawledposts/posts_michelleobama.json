She plans to attend law school and become an immigration lawyer, so she can help those who feel marginalized or left behind. Her advice to others in her shoes: ‚ÄúIf I could tell any student who‚Äôs wondering if they are worthy of going to college, please know that you are. You are able, you are strong, and you can do it.

And as those seedlings started to sprout, so did a national conversation about the way we feed our children, the impact of healthy food on underserved communities, and the beautiful things that happen when young people come together in a garden.\nSo I couldn‚Äôt be more proud of Ciara Byrne, one of our 2019 #ObamaFellows, who‚Äôs growing gardens like these across the desert to not only help kids learn science and math, but also understand the importance of taking care of our planet. Keep up the good work, @greenourplanet!"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1bs9EUnhdR/", "datetime": "2019-08-21T16:32:54.000Z", "img_urls": ["https://scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/cbbce5c7de2c94d9a2c1a63fe49c19c2/5DC69602/t51.2885-15/e35/67693340_152604732494062_2546474978842217496_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110"], "views": 1590064, "likes": 223806, "caption": "Watching #AmericanFactory, I thought a lot about my dad. That blustery Midwestern weather, the shift workers in their uniforms‚Äîit‚Äôs what he lived every day. His work was his pride and his sense of purpose; it‚Äôs what allowed him to pay the bills and send his two kids to college. I saw a lot of that dignity in this film; a spirit that connects us no matter if we‚Äôre in Chicago or Ohio, no matter what we look like or what our background is.\n\nThis documentary portrays that pride, and adds in all sorts of depth and layers and complications, which makes it exactly the kind of storytelling Barack and I hope to accomplish with Higher Ground Productions. We want to help foster an ability to see ourselves in each other‚Äôs stories. That‚Äôs something we talked about with Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar, who directed American Factory, over coffee. See for yourself at the link in the bio and then check out their excellent documentary, which is now streaming on @Netflix."}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1FFx99AKe5/", "datetime": "2019-08-12T21:46:51.000Z", "img_urls": ["https://scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/983efcc74905de407fb135d811748c06/5E52919D/t51.2885-15/e35/66493837_1099491383773355_4658928593855192734_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111"], "likes": 630208, "caption": "Always breaking barriers, @SimoneBiles‚Äîcouldn‚Äôt be more proud of you!"}]
