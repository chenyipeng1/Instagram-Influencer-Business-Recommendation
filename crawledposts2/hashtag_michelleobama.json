Since the #IAmBecoming tour came to a close, I found myself reflecting on many of the conversations I had with so many of you—from the book clubs and community groups I visited to all the thoughtful comments and conversations we had online. I noticed so many of us face a common challenge—that no matter who we are or where we come from, too often, we convince ourselves that our stories don’t matter.  So, as we approach a New Year, I wanted to find a way to help us all embrace our own stories. That’s what the Becoming Journal is all about—reflecting on our lives, especially the tiniest details. That’s how we can keep becoming—by seeing our stories for the powerful truths that they are, and then, by reaching out to each other and embracing all the vulnerability, the wisdom, and the twists and turns that both make our journeys so unique—and bind us together so tightly.

I first met Lin more than a decade ago, when he came to the White House to perform the opening number from what he described as a “concept album.” And, as we all know, his little concept, Hamilton, became a global phenomenon. But what I love most is that he believes it’s his duty to lift up those around him, especially the next generation. It’s why he’s created a Hamilton curriculum for schools, made sure kids from all over can see his shows, and raised millions of dollars for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. And it’s why he is working so hard to make sure folks are voting in every election and using that freedom that so many fought so hard for. He’s someone who has, in melody and rhyme and connection, painted as honest a portrait of our country as I’ve ever seen.
