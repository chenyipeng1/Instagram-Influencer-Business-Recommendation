We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.‚Äù‚ú® Today we remember planetary scientist Carl Sagan on his birthday. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nWithin a galaxy hosting around 300 billion stars, here @NASAHubble has captured a mere handful or two. These stars fall within NGC 1333, located about 1,000 light-years away in the constellation of Perseus. The cool gas and dust concentrated in this region is generating new stars whose light is then reflecting off the surrounding material, lighting it up and making this object‚Äôs lingering presence known to us.‚Å£\n‚Å£\n#NASA #Hubble #Space #Stars #Astronomy #CarlSaganDay", "hashtags": ["NASA", "Hubble", "Space", "Stars", "Astronomy", "CarlSaganDay"]}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4nrspCphnB/", "datetime": "2019-11-08T21:46:32.000Z", "img_urls": ["https://scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/72948234_739043509854517_6461292861247805852_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&oh=1ee8da0ba94267a54fcf53ac9cb6e748&oe=5E6ADF32", "https://scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/72976944_261298918181287_9153857561633553974_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&oh=1547af3089d7c4f1c0a0765cc92cda9a&oe=5E80D0DF", "https://scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/71921109_150167353006149_5092578628943464580_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&oh=130405613878ea62cd4bcaa195a67196&oe=5E668139", "https://scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/75296734_1397609867077544_3219815629804809754_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&oh=c5a4fdbbbb8722501774e760d337f569&oe=5E6A58D8", "https://scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/76967175_413567685981533_4990475810570673997_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&oh=d629976fad106adf215028964642bf96&oe=5E7954D0", "https://scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/74903094_553657091877225_6804795989368443859_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&oh=284d75d294788328010ff8bcc3eb77fd&oe=5E840875"], "likes": 745577, "caption": "The \"intricate, mesmerizing patterns of the International Space Station (@ISS) solar arrays.\" ‚òÄÔ∏è‚Å£\n‚Å£\nThe second image here is a close-up taken by @Astro_Jessica on Nov. 7 during a photo survey of the arrays, which convert solar energy to electrical power. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nIn the space station's orbit 220 miles above Earth, the best source of energy is sunlight.
